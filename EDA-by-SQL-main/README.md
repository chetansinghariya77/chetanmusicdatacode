# EDA of Music Store Data by SQL
As part of a music store database analysis project, I utilized SQL queries to extract valuable insights from a relational database. 

## Key Features
- Employee Management: The database includes employee information such as employee ID, name, title, contact details, and hierarchy.
- Customer Analysis: The customer table stores customer details, including their ID, name, company, contact information, and support representative ID.
- Invoice Tracking: The database allows tracking invoices, including invoice ID, customer ID, invoice date, billing address, and total amount.
- Track and Genre Information: Tracks are categorized by genre, and the database provides details about each track's name, album ID, media type ID, composer, duration, and price.
- Playlist Creation: Playlists can be created and managed, associating tracks with specific playlists.
- Artist and Album Details: The database maintains information about artists, including their ID and name, and albums, including album ID, title, and associated artist ID.

## Data Analysis Tasks
The following data analysis tasks were performed on the music store database:

- Employee Count: Determined the total number of employees in the organization.
- Senior Most Employee: Identified the senior most employee based on job title and hierarchy.
- Total Sales Amount: Calculated the total sales amount from invoices.
